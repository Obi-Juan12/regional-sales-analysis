## Analysis and Key Insights

### Revenue Share by Channel

* Wholesale is the biggest contributor with revenue of $668 million.
* Distributor is the second biggest contributor with $387 million in revenue.

### Top 10 States by Number of Orders

* California has the highest number of orders (7,613) and is critical to maintain service levels and competitive positioning.
* States like Illinois, Florida, and Texas are also strong markets.

### Total Monthly Sales Trend (Excluding 2018)

* The strongest month is May with $102.3 million.
* The weakest month is February with $91.3 million, which shows a demand dip and can be caused by post-holiday slowdowns.
* Marketing, promotions, and inventory stocking should be prioritized in November and December due to strong sales in these months.
* Special promotions or targeted campaigns can be used to increase demand during weak periods like February and April.
